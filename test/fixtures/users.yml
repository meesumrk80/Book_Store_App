# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
# Note that if you have a password field, you should use
# column: value
one:
  name: "Alice"
  email: "alice@example.com"
  password_digest: <%= BCrypt::Password.create('password123') %>

two:
  name: "Bob"
  email: "bob@example.com"
  password_digest: <%= BCrypt::Password.create('securepass') %>
